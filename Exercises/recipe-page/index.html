            Fluffy, cozy, and full of banana bread flavor, these pancakes are

        <h1> Ingredients You’ll Need </h1>
        <p> 
            A handful of pantry staples make these pancakes extra special:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Ripe bananas:</b> The secret to deep banana flavor and 
                natural sweetness
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Buttermilk:</b> Keeps the pancakes fluffy and light 
                and airy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Brown sugar:</b> Adds caramel notes that pair 
                perfectly with banana.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Baking powder + baking soda:</b> Helps the 
                pancakes rise and stay soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Butter:</b> For that golden, flavorful 
                edge (you can use oil, but butter adds
                richness). You can also brown it for extra 
                flavor in the pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Walnuts and mini chocolate chips:</b>
                The perfect textural combo and 
                traditional add ins to banana bread — 
                crunchy, melty, and cozy. Feel free to 
                swap with any nuts you like such as 
                pecans or leave them out.
            </li>
            <p>
                <b>Tip:</b> If you only have regular 
                milk, you can make a quick <b> homemade buttermilk</b> by
                mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or 
                vinegar and letting it sit for 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <h1>How To Make It</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Mash the bananas</b>
                In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until mostly smooth with 
                a few small chunks left for texture is totally ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Whisk the wet ingredients</b>        
                Add in the egg, melted butter, vanilla extract, and cold 
                buttermilk. Whisk until smooth and creamy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Mix the dry ingredients</b>
                In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking 
                powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Combine everything</b>
                Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use a rubber spatula 
                to fold until just combined.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Don’t overmix!</b>
                A few lumps in the batter are perfect — that’s what keeps 
                pancakes fluffy instead of dense.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cook the pancakes</b>
                Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat and add about 
                1/2 tablespoon of butter to melt. Once it starts bubbling, scoop
                about 1/2 cup of batter for each pancake (or smaller if you
                prefer minis).
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon as the batter hits the pan, sprinkle a few 
                <b>walnuts and mini chocolate chips</b> on top — they’ll melt 
                and toast slightly once you flip. Cook until bubbles form on top
                and the edges start to look set, then flip and cook until golden
                brown.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Tip:</b>
                If you’re using a griddle, you can cook 3–4 pancakes at a time, 
                which makes breakfast so much quicker (and perfect for big 
                batches).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Variation:</b>
                Want to make them a little extra banana-forward? Add a few 
                <b>thin slices of banana directly</b> onto each pancake before 
                flipping — they’ll caramelize beautifully.
            </p>
        </ul>
