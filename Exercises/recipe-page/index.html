        <h1> Ingredients You’ll Need </h1>
        <p> 
            A handful of pantry staples make these pancakes extra special:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Ripe bananas:</b> The secret to deep banana flavor and 
                    natural sweetness
                    <li>
                        <b>Buttermilk:</b> Keeps the pancakes fluffy and light 
                        and airy.
                        <li>
                            <b>Brown sugar:</b> Adds caramel notes that pair 
                            perfectly with banana.
                            <li>
                                <b>Baking powder + baking soda:</b> Helps the 
                                pancakes rise and stay soft.
                                <li>
                                    <b>Butter:</b> For that golden, flavorful 
                                    edge (you can use oil, but butter adds
                                    richness). You can also brown it for extra 
                                    flavor in the pancakes.
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Walnuts and mini chocolate chips:</b>
                                        The perfect textural combo and 
                                        traditional add ins to banana bread — 
                                        crunchy, melty, and cozy. Feel free to 
                                        swap with any nuts you like such as 
                                        pecans or leave them out.
                                    </li>

                                        <b>Tip:</b> If you only have regular 
                                        milk, you can make a quick <b>
                                            homemade buttermilk</b> by mixing 1 
                                            cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of 
                                            lemon juice or vinegar and letting 
                                            it sit for 5 minutes.
